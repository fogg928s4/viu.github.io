# Vi Unimproved

## Why?
This is just a simple JS project made to emulate the functionality of the popular family of text editors based on Vi. All trademarks of Vi belong to their respective owners.

## How
Simply clone the repo and open the neo.html on your favourite browser. By writing `w <File Name>` on the bottom text box you can save whatever you wrote.

## Clarification
This is the same repository as the one found ins `https://github.com/fogg928s4/viu`. This one is made to test github pages tho.
